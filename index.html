<h2>The History of Finding Her</h2>
<p> My tortoise was found by my grandmother, while it was crossing the street. She then picked it up and brought it to use in the year 2000. She gave it to my parents as a house warming present because my parents just bought our house.</p>
    
<h2>My Tortoise's Lover and Her Babies</h2>
<p>A few years after we had our tortoise, my Dad's friend found another one. He was male. He was found at a park being drowned by some Asian person. For some reason he had a small hole in his shell on the corner of it. For years they lived together in the backyard. They mated, and every year and one year the eggs hatched. About 10 baby tortoises were born. My dog then murdered all of them except one. We brought that one inside and he survived for about 4 months. In the year 2012 the male turtle went missing so all she had was a dog to socialize with but now he is dead. She has the whole backyard to herself now. </p>

<h2>My Tortoise's Favorite Foods</h2>
<p>My tortoise enjoys eating any vegetables, fruits, or plants she cand find. Some vegetables she enjoys are cucumbers and lettuce. Some fruits she enjoys are strawberries, apples, figs, and watermelon. Watermelon is by far her favorite food. She also will not eat lettuce if it is wilted Some plants that she eats are grass, rose pedals, and sometimes weeds.</p>
